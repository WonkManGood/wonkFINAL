hi, im wonkmanbad (wonkmangood on git). im a dude in North USA who flunked college twice and can barely concept basic
maths. i originally went for a degree related to photography and was later diagnosed with a rare eye disorder that hindered
my ability to really pursue that. i went again a few years later for a general degree in computer science but once again,
flunked due to low motivation. while i did withdraw from college, i grew really passionate about programming and its related
topics; specifically topics related to Security and Network Engineering. a good start in those fields was python and too which,
i found cs50. its been an on and off journey with you guys. my git repo is private, but theres a significate 2 months gap from
when i dropped interest in this class and finished it. and im glad to say, i more or less finished it.

nonetheless, heres my final project! hope you enjoy and give me many A+'s.
