  <summary>Personal Introduction</summary>
  
    hi, im wonkmanbad (wonkmangood on git). im a dude in North USA who flunked college twice and can barely concept basic
    maths. i originally went for a degree related to photography and was later diagnosed with a rare eye disorder that hindered
    my ability to really pursue that. i went again a few years later for a general degree in computer science but once again,
    flunked due to low motivation. while i did withdraw from college, i grew really passionate about programming and its related
    topics; specifically topics related to Security and Network Engineering. a good start in those fields was python and too which,
    i found cs50. its been an on and off journey with you guys. my git repo is private, but theres a significate 2 months gap from
    when i dropped interest in this class and finished it. and im glad to say, i more or less finished it.

    nonetheless, heres my final project! hope you enjoy and give me many A+'s.

# **wonkCIPHER**: mimic of randomart for text
#### **Video Demo**:  <URL HERE>
#### **Description**:
wonkCIPHER is a clone of [randomart](https://github.com/ansemjo/randomart) with functionality 
strictly to text-inputs with more interactibility; offering terminal outputs, random gen, etc.

While yes, it is not a rather *efficient* way of means to cipher data, but more so a proof of concept. While tested rigioursly, I am sure certain inputs or interactions with this program are less than effecient. wonkCIPHER is a collection of the knowledge I've gained in cs50 edX's Python Course and my own personal research.
